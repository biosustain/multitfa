    "2. Metabolite KEGG/SEED identifiers - This is required to match and retrieve thermodyanamic information against our database. Metabolite identifiers can be added to the multiTFA model later. For simplicity, we use the same nomneclature as `equilibrator-api`. \n",

    "3. Compartment specific pH and ionic strength information. To calculate Gibbs energy related to transmembrane transport, information about membrane potential is also required in the form of pandas Dataframes. \n",

    "Additionally, for accurate thermodynamic calculations, intracellular metabolite concentrations can be provided. \n",
