    "multiTFA model solver is a `optlang` model. By adding the thermodynamic constraints to the model, you're adding new variables and constraints to the `optlang` model. `optlang` currently, doesn't support quadratic constraints. So, we currently support `Cplex/Gurobi` solvers for MIQC problems. You have to access the MIQCP through the model's `gurobi_interface/cplex_interface`. These interfaces are accessible depending on what solver you are using to solve the optlang model. For example, if you are using `Cplex` as your default solver, `cplex_interface` will be available to solve the MIQCP. You can always change the solver using,\n",
