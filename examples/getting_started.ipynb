    "multiTFA is a python package for accurate thermodynamic flux analysis. multiTFA is built on COBRApy to take advantage of COBRA model structure. For installation instructions please refer to **INSTALL.rst**.\n",

    "## 1.1. Building a multiTFA model\n",
    "\n",
    "multiTFA models can be readily constructed from COBRA model objects. To create a model, we require \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A COBRA model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Metabolite KEGG/SEED identifiers - This is required to match and retrieve thermodyanamic information against our database. Metabolite identifiers can be added to the multiTFA model later. For simplicity, we use the same nomneclature as `equilibrator-api`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compartment specific pH and ionic strength information. To calculate Gibbs energy related to transmembrane transport, information about membrane potential is also required in the form of pandas Dataframes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for accurate thermodynamic calculations, intracellular metabolite concentrations can be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: All the input information should be in S.I units, e.g: ionic strength, metabolite concentration in Moles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the usage, we use *E. Coli* core model from `BIGG database`.\n"

This can be done by populating the 'Kegg_id' property of the metabolites. If you do not know the identifier for some metabolites, it is okay, you can simply add `NA` against it. For simplicity, we use the notation similar to equilibrator api. For the example below in the *E. coli* core model, we use bigg identifiers. You can follow equilibrator api notation for other database identifiers, for example, if you are using `KEGG` identifier, simply use `kegg:kegg identifier`."
